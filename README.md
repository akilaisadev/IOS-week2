# PlayHub - iOS Coursework Project

PlayHub is a native iOS application built with SwiftUI as part of the iOS development coursework. The application integrates three interactive mini-games into a unified arcade platform featuring persistent gameplay tracking, interactive map visualization, dynamic statistical charts, local notifications, and native social sharing.

## Project Architecture & Tech Stack

* **UI Framework**: SwiftUI (`TabView`, `NavigationStack`, `SwiftUI Charts`)
* **Location Services**: CoreLocation & MapKit (`CLLocationManager`, `MapAnnotation`, `MKCoordinateRegion`)
* **Notifications Engine**: `UNUserNotificationCenter` (`UNCalendarNotificationTrigger`)
* **Audio & Haptics**: `AVFoundation` & `UIKit` (`AVAudioPlayer` in-memory PCM synthesis, `UIImpactFeedbackGenerator`)
* **Persistence Layer**: `UserDefaults` & `@AppStorage` (Codable JSON session records)

## Core Features & Modules

### 1. Interactive Mini-Games (`HomeTab` & `Views/Games/`)
* **Tap Frenzy**: A fast-paced reflex challenge where players tap a moving and shrinking target button. Features include:
  * Dynamic combo multipliers awarding up to 5x points for rapid consecutive taps.
  * Penalty trap states that penalize points if tapped while active.
  * Target size scaling based on total tap volume.
  * Periodic bonus bursts awarding extra points and timer extensions every 10 taps.
* **Light It Up**: A visual pattern memory game that illuminates sequences on a grid. Players test their short-term spatial memory by reproducing progressively longer card sequences under time pressure.
* **Quiz Rush**: A rapid-fire trivia game with instant color-coded feedback and score tracking.

### 2. Statistical Visualization (`StatsTab`)
* Powered by `SwiftUI Charts`, the statistics tab provides deep insights into player performance across all games.
* **Mode Filtering**: Users can filter analytics between All Games, Tap Frenzy, Light It Up, and Quiz Rush.
* **Data Views**:
  * Bar charts displaying score distributions and recent game performance.
  * Sector graphs (pie charts) breaking down games played by mode.
  * Summary metrics highlighting personal bests, average scores, and cumulative points achieved.

### 3. Geolocation & Interactive Map (`MapTab`)
* **Automatic Coordinate Capture**: When a player concludes a game session, `LocationService` retrieves current GPS coordinates using `CLLocationManager`.
* **Map Display**: Recorded sessions are plotted on an interactive `MapKit` view using custom colored markers corresponding to the game mode played.
* **Interactive Callouts**: Tapping a map pin displays a detailed card showing the score achieved, game mode, and exact timestamp.

### 4. Application Settings & Notifications (`SettingsTab`)
* **Daily Challenge Reminders**: Users can enable and schedule recurring local reminders (`UNCalendarNotificationTrigger`) to prompt daily gameplay sessions.
* **Audio Mute Control**: Provides a master toggle that instantly silences or restores synthesized sound effects across `SoundManager.shared`.
* **Data Management**: Includes a secure reset button with a destructive confirmation dialog allowing users to clear all recorded history and map locations.

### 5. Post-Game Results & Sharing (`Views/Shared/`)
* **Celebratory Result View**: Dynamically detects when a player achieves a new personal best (`ScoreBadge`) and updates visual styling accordingly.
* **Native ShareLink Integration**: Uses SwiftUI `ShareLink` to generate formatted achievement strings (`"I just scored 150 points in Tap Frenzy on PlayHub! Can you beat my score?"`) that can be shared via Messages, Mail, or social applications.

## Build & Verification Instructions

### Requirements
* **macOS**: 13.0 or later
* **Xcode**: 15.0 or later (with iOS 16.0+ Simulator SDK)
* **Swift**: 5.9+

### Running via Command Line
To compile and build the application cleanly using `xcodebuild`:

```bash
cd myapp-1
xcodebuild -project myapp-1.xcodeproj -scheme myapp-1 -destination 'generic/platform=iOS Simulator' build
```

### Running via Xcode IDE
1. Open `myapp-1.xcodeproj` in Xcode.
2. Select an iPhone target (e.g., iPhone 15 or iPhone 16 Simulator) from the active scheme dropdown.
3. Press `Cmd + R` to build and run the project.
